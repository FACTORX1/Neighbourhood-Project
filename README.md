# Neighbourhood-Project
In this project developed a single page application featuring a map of my neighbourhood or a neighbourhood I would like to visit. After this added functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content. The neighbourhood map application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable and many employers are looking for specific skills in using these packages.
